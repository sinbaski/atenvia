\section{volatility contraction \& breakouts}
Define for $k \in \naturals$
\begin{eqnarray*}
  H_k &=&   \sup_{k-1 < s \leq k} P_s \\
  L_k &=&   \inf_{k-1 < s \leq k} P_s 
\end{eqnarray*}
At time $t$, find the day $m$:
\[
  m = \max\left\{l \leq k \leq \floor t - 1:
  H_k \geq \max_{k < l \leq \floor t} H_l,
  \;
  L_k \leq \min_{k < l \leq \floor t} L_l
  \right\}
\]
A breakout happens at day $\ceil t$ if $L_{\ceil t} \geq H_m$ or
$H_{\ceil t} \leq L_m$. They indicate upward/downward trends
respectively.
The idea is that contracted volatility (as measured by the high-low
difference) followed by a breakout indicates the beginning of a trend.
The 3 quantities - volume, range, and $\var(\log P_t - \log P_{t-1})$
are expected to be highly dependent, as they all describe volatility.
